# Battleship

## Description

Run battleship_test.rb to pass tests.

Run play.rb to play game with two human players and a standard set of 5 ships.

## To play game

Enter a name for each player, and enter coordinates to place each ship for each player.

Coordinates should be in the format "[letter][number]," where [letter] is between A and J (case insensitive), and [number] is between 1 and 10.
This places a ship starting with this coordinate as the upper left corner.

The players will also be prompted to indicate if the ship is to be placed "down" (vertical) or "across" (horizontal). This is not case sensitive.

Once all of the ships have been placed, each player takes turns guessing coordinates. Again, the coordinates are to be entered in the format "[letter][number]"

Players will continue to be prompted for guesses until one player guesses the locations of all of the opponent's ships.
