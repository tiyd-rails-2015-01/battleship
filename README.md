# Battleship

## Description

This is my Battleship game!

## Objectives

To play against either the computer or another player and beat them!

### Gameplay

The game gives you five ships, each with a certain number of hit points. You will place the ships giving X, Y coordinates and then try to find your opponent's in order to destroy them.

When you shoot, name the coordinates you're aiming at (A3, D4, etc). Your target board will record whether you hit their ship. You sink the ship by hitting all the squares that it covers. Once you sink all their ships, you win!


### Requirements

Simply run the battleship.rb file!
