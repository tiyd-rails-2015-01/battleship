# Battleship

## How to play

To play, open up the battleship.rb file and run

game= Game.new() inputing the players as the first two parameters and the amount of ships that you want with their lengths as the second.
so, for example "# game= Game.new(HumanPlayer.new(John), ComputerPlayer.new, [2])"

and then input "game.play" below it. Then run battleship.rb
